# TicTacToe

This is a server and client written in Python3. Client allows user to login on launched
server and play TicTacToe with other LAN users. The connections are using socket
library while GUI is made using pygame and some objects (buttons, text fields, etc.)
implemented by me. The server also stores its connection log and players scores
